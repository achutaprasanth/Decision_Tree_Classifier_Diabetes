# Decision_Tree_Classifier_Diabetes

The main task we are going to perform here is to determine whether the person is diabetic or non-diabetic. I have downloaded the dataset from an online resource and then I have developed a decision tree classifier which predicts the state of the person based on a few sets of attributes.

The sets of attributes are as follows:
Pregnancy period - The number of months the person is pregnant
Glucose level -  The blood sugar level, blood sugar concentration, or blood glucose level is the concentration of glucose present in the blood of humans.
BP level - The force of circulating blood on the walls of the arteries.
Skin - Skin tone
Insulin level - Insulin is a hormone that lowers the level of glucose (a type of sugar) in the blood.
BMI - Body Mass Index
Pedigree - A value for the pedigree chart to be made
Age - Age factor
